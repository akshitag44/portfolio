                                <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                                <p>Gucci. Apple. Zara. All of these websites have
                                beautiful products, and they have a website 
                                matching that elegance. These websites that 
                                attract customers are made by Web Developers, 
                                and after college, I <strong>maybe</strong> want to 
                                become one. When I am asked the question, "What 
                                do you want to be when you grow up?", I was never
                                sure how to answer that question. The truth is, 
                                I have a lot of interests in very different fields.
                                I also want to do CGI in movies, and edit them. 
                                I want to create music and produce songs for 
                                aspiring musicians. As I go through my years of 
                                high school, I will explore these other interests, 
                                but I do in fact want to become a web developer, 
                                because it is something that interests me and I 
                                want to move forward in this field. Taking this 
                                Computer Science course is the first step, and I
                                hope I am able to go to the Engineering Academy 
                                later. I want to take AP Computer Science and 
                                graduate high school with an Advanced Scholar 
                                Diploma. My college preferences are UC Berkeley 
                                or Caltech, maybe more. Becoming a web developer
                                and creating websites interests me most, and I 
                                can't wait to dive into that field.

                                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                                <p>As a web developer, or any job at all, there 
                                are many skills that you need in order to do that
                                job successfully. A web developer must be patient.
                                There is a lot of patience required
                                in web development, because of the amount of code
                                that needs to be written. I have aquired that 
                                certain skill, and I can prove that claim from 
                                my tutoring experience. Over the summer, I tutored
                                first-graders in math, including addition, 
                                subtraction, and more. For us, all of these 
                                concepts are really basic in the world of 
                                mathematics, but for first-graders, this was a 
                                very new concept and almost foreign to them. 
                                This mean they often forget  learned concepts. 
                                Because of that, I had to have a lot of patience
                                teaching, and I had to be understanding. The kids
                                also would not want to do work at times, and this
                                would show me being as cooperative. If it was hot,
                                long day, and there was too many problems, I would
                                often let them finish those problems up later in 
                                their own time. I would let them take breaks, so 
                                they're not too overwhelmed by the workload. Web 
                                development is often done with others, and you 
                                have to be cooperative for that.</p>
                                
                                <p>In high school, I have been taking such courses
                                as Algebra 2/Trigonometry, Advanced English, and 
                                French 2. For clubs, I am in Red Cross, Dublin 
                                PATCH, and Photography. I will be trying out for
                                the Lacrosse team in Spring 2018. I consider 
                                myself as someone who can improve themself and 
                                learn from experiences. In 8th grade, I was taking
                                an Algebra1 class with a hard teacher. When time for 
                                midterms came, I did not do well. I had not studied
                                enough and did not have a broad understanding of 
                                all the concepts given in the class. But I learned
                                from that experience and my mistakes, and when the 
                                time came for finals, I was up studying every night, 
                                pushing myself, and making sure I knew every topic 
                                that could come on the test. All my hard work paid 
                                off, and I did very well on finals. I was able to 
                                take a bad experience and make sure that I wouldn't
                                make the same mistakes again.</p>
                                
                                <p>To get a full view on the skills and work 
                                experience I have, you can check my resume
