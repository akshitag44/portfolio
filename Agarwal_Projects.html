                  <h3>Project: Space Invaders</h3>
                  <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>
                  <h3>Duration: August 30, 2018 - September 6, 2018</h3>
                  
                  <p>When my partner and I got handed our MIT App Inventor Project, 
                  we immediately chose the game Space Invaders. Space Invaders is a 
                  retro arcade game from the late 70s. The goal of the game is to 
                  shoot all the aliens every round while they come closer and closer
                  to you. Once they touch you, the game is over. While working on 
                  this project, my partner and I split the work in half, and we 
                  distributed all of it. We both did documentation, we both did the 
                  coding, and we both worked hard on the project. While working on 
                  this project, the game presented a lot of different problems, and 
                  through this, I learned a new way to approach solutions and boost 
                  creativity. Both my partner and I approached one problem in a 
                  million different ways, and I feel like I benefited from this 
                  project because it forced me to think creatively.</p>

                  <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>

                  <p>This my most recent and one of my proudest projects, aside 
                  from this website itself. We were given a task where we had to 
                  find a cause, and create a campaign for it by taking ordinary 
                  images and turning them into "posters" by only using Python.
                  My partner and I had decided to create a presidential campaign
                  for the soon to be running president, Kamala Harris. We found
                  images on the internet that represent her and her campaign and
                  created poster for it. I also used some other skills I have,
                  like photoshop to create a logo. This was a fun project to 
                  work on, and it helped me express the creativity I have.

                        Over the summer of 2020, we were asked to code and model 
                        a virus based of the recent events we had experienced. 
                        By first watching videos on learning how to operate 
                        around a platform/virtual world called Greenfoot, we were 
                        able to create this model of a contagion spreading through
                        a population. After learning how to model this epidemic, we
                        were split into groups and told to add our own twist to this
                        model. We did this by adding immunity to this model, stating that
                        after a certain amount of time a person would be immunte to getting
                        this virus. Along with that we added the difference between a masked
                        and unmasked person having this virus. Read more about the project

                        As we neared the end of 2020, my group and I were given
                        another project to work on. We needed to make an educational
                        game, so we decided to base our game around introducing the idea 
                        of stocks to little kids. Our game was made and modeled through
                        Greenfoot, and follows a simple "Choose Your Path" pattern. The entire
                        documentation to this project is listed below:

                        During the beginning of 2021, my group and I had to work on
                        a project relating to new Java library. All of our group members
                        had interests in music, and luckily we were able to find a Java library
                        that matched our interests in music and programming. Our project
                        was a program that used machine learning and AI to give users new content
                        and chord progression. This project was definitely unique and interesting to 
                        do. The documentation to this project is listed below:
