                  <h3>Project: Space Invaders</h3>
                  <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>

                  <p>When my partner and I got handed our MIT App Inventor Project, 
                  we immediately chose the game Space Invaders. Space Invaders is a 
                  retro arcade game from the late 70s. The goal of the game is to 
                  shoot all the aliens every round while they come closer and closer
                  to you. Once they touch you, the game is over. While working on 
                  this project, my partner and I split the work in half, and we 
                  distributed all of it. We both did documentation, we both did the 
                  coding, and we both worked hard on the project. While working on 
                  this project, the game presented a lot of different problems, and 
                  through this, I learned a new way to approach solutions and boost 
                  creativity. Both my partner and I approached one problem in a 
                  million different ways, and I feel like I benefited from this 
                  project because it forced me to think creatively.</p>

                  <h3>Project: PIL Image Manipulation</h3>
                  <h3>Course: Computer Science Principles</h3>
                  <h3>Duration: March 03, 2019 - March 23, 2019</h3>
                  
                  <p>This my most recent and one of my proudest projects, aside 
                  from this website itself. We were given a task where we had to 
                  find a cause, and create a campaign for it by taking ordinary 
                  images and turning them into "posters" by only using Python.
                  My partner and I had decided to create a presidential campaign
                  for the soon to be running president, Kamala Harris. We found
                  images on the internet that represent her and her campaign and
                  created poster for it. I also used some other skills I have,
                  like photoshop to create a logo. This was a fun project to 
                  work on, and it helped me express the creativity I have.
