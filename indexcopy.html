                                <p>My name is Akshit Agarwal. I am currently a 
                                freshman at Dublin High School. I have a lot of 
                                hobbies like creating music, playing sports, or 
                                writing out stories. I've been interested in Computer
                                Science ever since I was a little kid, when my love 
                                for video games started. As I played classic Nintendo
                                games like Super Mario Sunshine and Donkey Kong, I 
                                always had wondered on how these games were actually
                                made. As I grew older and older, I became more and 
                                more interested in the field of Computer Science. 
                                While I grew, my passions for basketball and creating
                                music had taken off, as I spent my time practicing 
                                and learning, but I still never lost that wonder for
                                Computer Science. Now that I am in the class, I am 
                                excited for what's to come and I look forward to a 
                                year of coding!</p>

                        <h4>2018</h4>
                        <p>During the summer of 2018, right before his first year 
                        of high school, Akshit spent time with kids and had 
                        tutored them. He helped them with lessons they were 
                        struggling with and found creative ways to teach them.</p>

                        <h2>Scratch- Maze Game</h2>
                        <h4>2018</h4>
                        <p>This game was designed by Akshit and it was his first
                        ever scratch project. It was a maze game that proved 
                        challenging, as many people try to beat the game, but 
                        can't make past Level 1.</p>
